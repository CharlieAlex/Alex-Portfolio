## Data Science Projects

### [ParkFinder App](https://parkfinder.streamlit.app/)

*Historical Data Tracking and Visualization of Taipei City Parking Spaces*

A project with my friend focusing on enhancing accessibility to real-time parking availability by retrieving data from Taipei City's official parking website. We transferred the data to AWS Cloud, enabling historical queries and providing valuable statistical insights. Additionally, we designed a user-friendly website to facilitate personalized searches, contributing to informed decision-making regarding parking choices in the city.
